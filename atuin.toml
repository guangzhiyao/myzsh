# Atuin configuration - Privacy-first, local-first defaults
# This configuration prioritizes local mode and privacy while providing
# sensible defaults for searching and history presentation.
#
# Notes:
# - auto_sync: disabled by default to avoid sending history to remote services.
# - local: true keeps the database local-only.
# - search_mode: 'fuzzy' gives the most flexible search experience for most users.
# - filter_mode: 'global' deduplicates history across sessions.
# - Adjust search_result_limit and preview_height to suit terminal size.

# Do not enable automatic syncing by default (privacy-preserving)
auto_sync = false

# If auto_sync is enabled, this controls how often (in seconds) to sync.
# Keep reasonable by default, but it's ignored while auto_sync = false.
sync_interval = 3600

# Search mode controls how Ctrl+R searches history:
# - "fuzzy" : fuzzy match (recommended)
# - "prefix": prefix-anchored matching
search_mode = "fuzzy"

# How to deduplicate repeated commands:
# - "session": dedupe within the same shell session
# - "global": dedupe across all sessions (recommended)
# - "none": keep all duplicates
filter_mode = "global"

# How many context lines to store with each entry (keeps some surrounding lines)
context_lines = 1

# How history entries are displayed:
# - "compact": short form (recommended)
# - "full": include timestamps and other metadata
history_format = "compact"

# Input mode used for the search UI (match your shell editing mode)
# Common values: "emacs" or "vi"
input_mode = "emacs"

# Prefer exact matches first in search results. Keep false for broader fuzzy-first results.
exact = false

# Maximum number of results to show in search
search_result_limit = 25

# How tall the preview pane should be (0 to disable). Requires terminal support.
preview_height = 4

# Enable or disable collection of usage statistics (local analytics)
# Keep false by default for privacy.
stats = true

# Log search queries for debugging/analytics - disabled by default
log_search = false

# Path to Atuin database (uncomment to override)
# db_path = "~/.local/share/atuin/history.db"

# Run in local-only mode (do not attempt to sync). Recommended for privacy-first setups.
local = true

# Color/styling settings are left to the terminal; Atuin will respect the terminal palette.
# If you want to force a theme, Atuin has more advanced settings—refer to Atuin docs.

# Stats sub-table: enable/disable specific stats collection features
[stats]
# Show common command prefixes in stats
common_prefix = true
# Show common subcommands (e.g., `git commit`, `git push`)
common_subcommands = true

# End of config
# To enable remote sync or other more advanced features, edit this file and
# set `auto_sync = true` and configure your Atuin server/credentials per docs.
